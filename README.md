# RatColonicAnastomosisData

This repository contains the data supporting the study titled "Advantages of Magnetic Compression in Rat Colonic Anastomosis: A Comparative Study with a Transcriptomic Perspective" by Shuqin Xu et al.

## Data Overview
This study compares the healing effects of magnetic compression anastomosis (MCA) and traditional suturing in rat colonic anastomosis. The repository includes:

- **Raw and processed RNA-seq data**: Transcriptomic profiles of the anastomotic sites.
- **Histological data**: Images and analysis results from H&E and Masson's trichrome staining.
- **Burst pressure measurements**: Data on the burst pressure of the anastomotic sites.
- **Survival rates**: Survival data for the MCA and control groups.
- **Analysis scripts**: Code used for data processing, differential gene expression analysis, and pathway enrichment.
